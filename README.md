#usage

For the purpose of fetching public repository information from GitHub, you can use a Personal Access Token with the "public_repo" scope, which grants read-only access to public repositories. This scope provides the necessary permissions for retrieving repository information.

When generating your personal access token on GitHub, ensure that you only grant the necessary permissions required for your task. In this case, since you're only fetching public repository information, you don't need more sensitive permissions.

Go to your GitHub account settings.
Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens."
Click on "Generate new token."
Give your token a descriptive name.
Select the scope public_repo.
Click on "Generate token" and make sure to copy the token immediately as it will not be shown again.
